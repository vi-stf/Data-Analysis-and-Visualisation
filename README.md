# First Graph (Choropleth Map)
Original Dataset: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/blog/maddison-project-database-2020-04-11-2020?lang=en

The chosen dataset is a very well structured dataset which allowed us to create the graph with minimum preprocessing on the data.

The graph shows how the Gross domestic product per capita is changing through the years ( from 1970 to 2018) for each country.
The color gradation depicted for each country implys the GDP per capita movement. The pallet main color is blue. The color hue moves from lighter to darker showing a smaller to bigger increase to GDP per capita value for each country. The submit button allows the user to change the year of interest and display for this year the value of the GDP per capita of each county.

# Second Graph (dashboard)
Original Dataset: Supported Dataset: 'https://www.kaggle.com/hamzael1/world-countries-income-class-2020'

Shows how the Birthrate, Deathrate and Infant Mortality are changing depending on different general predictors for each country.
The chosen predictors are the gross domestic product per capita, regions and countries. Those three predictors were chosen as based on the literature review they affect the most the three dependent variables. Three separate graphs were implemented with the x-axis having the values of each separate predictor and the y-axis having the value of one of three dependent variables. Therefore, the graph is a dashboard of one scatter plot for the GDP and two bar plots for the other two predictors. The different colours inside each graph represent the hue values and helps the viewer to dibranchiate the graph elements but at the same time to group them. The viewer can also choose to visualise the dashboard depending on the population as the first slider indicates.
