# Data-Analysis-and-Visualisation

First Graph (Choropleth Map)
Original Dataset: https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/blog/maddison-project-database-2020-04-11-2020?lang=en

The chosen dataset is a very well structured dataset which allowed us to create the graph with minimum preprocessing on the data.

The graph shows how the Gross domestic product per capita is changing through the years ( from 1970 to 2018) for each country.
The color gradation depicted for each country implys the GDP per capita movement. The pallet main color is blue. The color hue moves from lighter to darker showing a smaller to bigger increase to GDP per capita value for each country. The submit button allows the user to change the year of interest and display for this year the value of the GDP per capita of each county.
